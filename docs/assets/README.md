# Screenshot File

You'll need to add a screenshot image file named `screenshot.png` to this directory.

The website references this file in the main page. You can take a screenshot of the extension in action and save it here as `screenshot.png`.

Example screenshot content:
- Browser with text highlighted
- Context menu showing the "Check on OSINT Platforms" option
- Multiple tabs being opened to OSINT platforms

Until you add a real screenshot, the website will display an empty area where the screenshot should be.
