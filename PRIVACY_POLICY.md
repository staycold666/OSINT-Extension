# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 03/27/2025

## 1. Introduction
This OSINT Lookup Chrome Extension ("Extension") provides a quick way to check IP addresses, domain names, and file hashes on various Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) platforms.

## 2. Information We Collect

**User-Selected Text:** When you highlight text (such as an IP address or domain name) and use the Extension's right-click menu, the Extension processes that text to open OSINT results in new browser tabs. This text is not stored, logged, or transmitted to any server controlled by the Extension developer.

**No Other Data:** We do not collect or store any other user data, including personal information, browsing history, or analytics data.

## 3. How We Use the Information

The highlighted text is only used to perform lookups on third-party OSINT websites (e.g., VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, etc.). Once the tab is opened, the third-party site's privacy policy governs how they handle any data you provide to them. We do not control these third-party sites.

## 4. Data Sharing and Transfers

We do not share, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties.

Any data you enter on a third-party OSINT platform's website is subject to that platform's privacy policy.

## 5. Your Choices

Using this Extension is entirely optional.

If you do not want the Extension to open OSINT tabs, simply do not use the right-click option.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
